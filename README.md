# A Bakery HeadOffice System

A small business has decided that they want a new and modern system in which they can store all their accounting data. Such as balances from previous years and years to come with some more features.

Using outdated methods of storing balances such as excel sheets has led to a large quantity of files resulting in cluttering. Due to lack of organization and restrictions multiple staff members uses the same computers. Members with access to these files are under the suspicion that some unauthorized alterations have been made.
The employer requests a system that will:

*Restrict access to only the accountant for the new system.	

*Extract data from these excel sheets and store them into the new system permanently.

*The new system should allow the accountant to input further data in this system.

*Allow the accountant to view and alter any changes to the data.

*Allow a graph view of data as another means of viewing the data.
